Here's a simple [Shiny App](https://github.com/mariejohnson/portfolio/blob/master/fireApp/nppFireApp.md) that displays Net Primary Production at selected wildfire locations. 

To learn how to run the app check the [readme file.](https://github.com/mariejohnson/portfolio/tree/master/fireApp)

To see the internal workings of the app, look at this [code.](https://github.com/mariejohnson/portfolio/blob/master/fireApp/nppFireApp.Rmd)

Unfortunately, to host Shiny apps online you will need to pay for server hours through RStudio - but you can run them locally!
