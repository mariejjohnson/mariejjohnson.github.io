Glacial Lake Watershed Analysis with RGEE
This [code](https://github.com/mariejohnson/portfolio/blob/master/watershedAnalysis/code/watershedGPP.R) uses the R's API Google Earth Engine interface to extract Gross Primary Production (GPP) from several watersheds in northwestern Montana. This code was developed to help a fellow labmate that researches glacial lake formation.
