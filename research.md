In my work, I have created an integrated framework to quantify ecosystem resilience based on the recovery of ecosystem function, structure, and composition following wildfires. A simplified diagram is included below that gives examples of measurements of ecosystem function, structure, and composition.

Here are some preliminary results from wildfire that occurred in northwestern Montana in 2003. Below I look at the recovery of net primary production at this site. This site is divided into wilderness and forest service land. I have focused my work on the western portion (wilderness side) of the wildfire.

I first became interested in research studying accoustic communication in tree frogs when I attended the University of Minnesota in my undergraduate. This resulted in my first publication and inspired me to go to graduate school.
