Well, hey there - glad you made it!

I am a PhD student at the University of Montana. Iâ€™m interested in the intersection of technology and ecological research, specifically studying how ecosystems are responding to impacts of climate change. As climate change increases wildfire frequency and severity globally, my goal as a scientist is to use remote sensing to advance our understanding of ecosystem resilience and inform sustainable management practices. In my work, I have created an integrated framework to quantify ecosystem resilience based on the recovery of ecosystem function, structure, and composition following wildfires.
