During my time as a Data Science Fellow at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) I helped out with the State of Alaskan Salmon and People [project](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/workinggroups/state-alaskan-salmon-and-people-sasap) This [notebook](https://github.com/mariejohnson/spatial_analysis/blob/master/fish_passage.ipynb) looks at impacts to fish passage in Alaska.
