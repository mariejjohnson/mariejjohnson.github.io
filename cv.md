<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">This is the text that I want to indent. I want to create a margin on both sides so that it doesn't go the full width of the page. Don't ask me why I want to do this. I just do!</p>

	    	This paragraph is written to apply indentation on it. In Html
            indentation is something that is not needed because browsers automatically
            removes the extra white spaces but if you want to make your text look good
            for the reader then indentation is useful for you.
